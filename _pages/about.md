**Greening** is a dev automation engine built to help you **ship beautiful software fast**â€”repeatably, scalably, and without boilerplate burnout.

Every project should feel like itâ€™s already ready to launch. Greening helps you start strong, stay consistent, and look professional from the very first commit.

## ðŸŒ± Why "Greening"?

The name comes from the idea of growth. Of projects, of creators, of craft.

To "green" something is to bring it to lifeâ€”to make it real, vibrant, and visible. Greening is designed to help you do exactly that with your software ideas.

## ðŸ’¡ The Philosophy

Greening is opinionated by design. Itâ€™s built on a few strong principles:

- **Ship fast**  
  Donâ€™t waste time setting up the same files again and again. Let automation handle it.

- **Make it beautiful by default**  
  Polished repos, clean docs, and structured projectsâ€”baked in from the start.

- **Repeatable, scalable patterns**  
  Use one config file (`greening.yaml`) to scaffold, document, and publish consistent, high-quality projects.

- **Clean, concise, self-documenting code**  
  Projects scaffolded by Greening are clear, intentional, and easy to read and extend. Structure and naming guide you naturally.

## ðŸ§­ What Greening Does

Greening automates the early lifecycle of a project:

- **`greening init`** â†’ Creates a starter `greening.yaml` config
- **`greening new`** â†’ Scaffolds your project using Cookiecutter templates
- **`greening deploy`** â†’ Builds and publishes a static site (like docs or a landing page) to the `gh-pages` branch

With optional GitHub integration, it can:
- Automatically create a remote repository
- Push your first commit
- Deploy your site with zero manual setup

## ðŸ›  For Builders Who Care

Whether you're publishing a library, documenting a tool, or launching your next big ideaâ€”Greening gives you the scaffolding, structure, and momentum to do it right from the start.

> Build fast.  
> Ship proud.  
> Grow your garden of ideas.
