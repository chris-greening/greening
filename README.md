# ðŸŒ± Greening

**Greening** is an opinionated, full-stack project automation tool for solo developers and creative coders.

With a single command, you can scaffold a production-ready Python package â€” complete with docs, tests, GitHub Actions workflows, PyPI packaging, and an auto-deployed GitHub Pages site. No boilerplate. No setup hell. Just instant polish.

## ðŸ¤” Why Greening?

Most devs never ship their tools â€” not because the code isnâ€™t good, but because the surrounding friction is too high:
- How do I structure the project?
- How do I set up CI/CD, tests, and linting?
- How do I make it look legit?
- How do I talk about it?

Greening answers all of that in **one opinionated command**.
