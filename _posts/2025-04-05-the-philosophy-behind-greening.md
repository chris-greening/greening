> _"The best time to build is when you're most excited — so why does setup always get in the way?"_

When I started building **Greening**, it wasn’t just to automate project scaffolding. It was to protect something much more fragile: **momentum**.

## ⚙️ The Hidden Cost of Boilerplate

Every time I start a new project, I hit the same wall:
- Creating a README
- Spinning up a virtual environment
- Configuring GitHub Actions
- Deploying to GitHub Pages
- Setting up analytics, docs, versioning...

None of this is hard — but **it's all friction**. And that friction adds up right at the moment you're most energized and ready to create.

By the time everything's wired together, the excitement fades, and the magic of that initial idea gets buried under boilerplate.

## 🌱 Greening Is Built for Momentum

Greening is my attempt to **codify that initial burst of energy** — and make sure nothing slows it down.

With a single command like:

```bash
greening new
```

You're not just scaffolding a folder. You're generating:
- A working GitHub project
- A committed Git repo (optionally pushed)
- GitHub Actions wired up
- A PyPI-ready Python package
- Documentation deployed to GitHub Pages
- Optional Google Analytics tracking

No decisions to make. No boilerplate to copy. You can go from idea → working, publishable project in **seconds**.

## 🛠 Tools Are Philosophy

I’ve come to believe that developer tools encode values.

Greening encodes a belief that:
- Starting should be fast
- Publishing should be default
- Projects should look polished right out of the gate
- Repetition should be automated

Because the sooner we can remove friction, the sooner we can get to **the good stuff** — the real creative work.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

Greening is still early, but it’s growing fast. I’m working on:
- Plugin support for different stacks
- Automatic changelog generation
- Custom templates for repeatable custom GitHub Pages deployments

If you're someone who wants to spend less time setting up and more time shipping, I’d love your feedback.

**Let's spend less time on boilerplate and more time building.**  
That’s the heart of Greening.
