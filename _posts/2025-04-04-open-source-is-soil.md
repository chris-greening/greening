Open source is soil. Itâ€™s not just where we build â€” itâ€™s where things grow.

The name Greening carries meaning on many levels.

Yes, it's my last name â€” but more importantly, it reflects the philosophy behind the project and the process it encourages. Greening is an action. A transformation. The turning of raw space into fertile ground.

This project is an attempt to bottle what has worked for me: an opinionated framework, tuned through experience, designed to help ideas take root with clarity and speed.

ðŸŒ± Growth Through Iteration
In nature, growth is uneven. Shoots twist toward the light. Some seeds donâ€™t sprout. But the garden keeps expanding. The same is true in software. Version 0.1.0 isnâ€™t perfect â€” but itâ€™s alive.

Greening exists to make that early stage effortless â€” to remove friction from the planting process so developers can ship sooner and iterate faster. The first version doesnâ€™t have to be flawless. It just has to start growing.

ðŸŒ° Tools Are Seeds
Every scaffold, every config, every deploy is a seed â€” small, but full of potential. Greening gives you tools that sprout quickly, so you can spend less time building the planter and more time tending the plant.

With expressive syntax and beautiful defaults, it clears the weeds so your work can flourish.

ðŸŒ¿ Open Source Is Soil
The open-source ecosystem is a living commons. Code evolves. Ideas hybridize. Communities self-seed. In this shared soil, a single contribution can propagate far beyond its roots.

Greening is built for that environment. Itâ€™s not just an automation tool â€” itâ€™s a substrate for creative, scalable, repeatable growth. Tweak it. Fork it. Grow your own extensions. Contribute back.

ðŸŒ¾ Greening, Together
This project is opinionated â€” not because thereâ€™s one way to build, but because strong soil grows strong roots. Greening reflects one approach thatâ€™s worked â€” and makes it easy to remix for your own.

If you're here, youâ€™re already in the garden. Letâ€™s see what we can grow.
